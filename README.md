# PRODIGY_WD_03 â€“ Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is part of my **Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
It is an interactive **Tic Tac Toe Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Two Player Mode** â€“ Play with a friend locally
- **AI Mode** â€“ Challenge the computer
- **Win Detection** â€“ Highlights the winning combination
- **Draw Detection** â€“ Displays when the game ends in a tie
- **Scoreboard** â€“ Tracks wins, losses, and draws
- **Responsive Design** â€“ Works on both desktop and mobile screens

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the game board and UI elements
- **CSS** â€“ Styling for the board, cells, and animations
- **JavaScript** â€“ Game logic, turn handling, win conditions, and scoreboard

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works
1. Players take turns placing **X** or **O** on the board.  
2. The first to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.  
3. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.  
4. The scoreboard updates after each match.
